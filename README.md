# js-tips
Simple project working on JS tips

## Simple project looking at JS 'tip' videos on YouTube
	- Taking note on good code practices, and then using them in my own work
	- This project is a living resource.

## Goal
	- Learn some new ways to code
	- Use this project as a reference for doing things in proper ES6 / easy to read code

## Note
	- The code isn't going to be organized super well (ie no components folder) and most front-end code will be done in the App.js file
	-- The goal of this weekend project is to get new tools / code styles, not a well structored project
